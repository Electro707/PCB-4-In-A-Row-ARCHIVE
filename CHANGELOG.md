        - Added on-off switch
        - Replaced Darlington transistor pair IC with individual MOSFETs
- Rev B:
    - Rev B1:
        - Complete redesign to use an ATmega328P and 74HC595s instead of the STM32
        - Seperated the driver board and LED board

        - Removed "Connect-4" trademarked silkscreen text (except I forgot to change it in the back of the PCB)
    - Rev B4:
        - Added FT230X for easy programming
        - Changed ALL "Connect-4" references to "4-In-A-Row" due to potential trademark issues
    - Rev B5 (Current) (WIP):
