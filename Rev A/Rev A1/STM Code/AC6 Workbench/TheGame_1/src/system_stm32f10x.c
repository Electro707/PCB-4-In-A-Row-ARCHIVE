  * @author  MCD Application Team
  * @version V3.5.0
  * @date    11-March-2011
  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  * 
  * 1.  This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
  *     user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): Setups the system clock (System clock source, PLL Multiplier
  *                      factors, AHB/APBx prescalers and Flash settings). 
  *                      This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f10x_xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *                                     
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
  *
  * 2. After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source.
  *    Then SystemInit() function is called, in "startup_stm32f10x_xx.s" file, to
  *    configure the system clock before to branch to main program.
  *
  * 3. If the system clock source selected by user fails to startup, the SystemInit()
  *    function will do nothing and HSI still used as system clock source. User can 
  *    add some code to deal with this issue inside the SetSysClock() function.
  *
  * 4. The default value of HSE crystal is set to 8 MHz (or 25 MHz, depedning on
  *    the product used), refer to "HSE_VALUE" define in "stm32f10x.h" file. 
  *    When HSE is used as system clock source, directly or through PLL, and you
  *    are using different crystal you have to adapt the HSE value to your own
  *    configuration.
  *

/*!< Uncomment the line corresponding to the desired System clock (SYSCLK)
   frequency (after reset the HSI is used as SYSCLK source)
   
   IMPORTANT NOTE:
   ============== 
   1. After each device reset the HSI is used as System clock source.

   2. Please make sure that the selected System clock doesn't exceed your device's
      maximum frequency.
      
   3. If none of the define below is enabled, the HSI is used as System clock
    source.

   4. The System clock configuration functions provided within this file assume that:
        - For Low, Medium and High density Value line devices an external 8MHz 
          crystal is used to drive the System clock.
        - For Low, Medium and High density devices an external 8MHz crystal is
          used to drive the System clock.
        - For Connectivity line devices an external 25MHz crystal is used to drive
          the System clock.
     If you are using different crystal you have to adapt those functions accordingly.
